<p>When I started programming it was just for my enjoyment, I would sometimes show stuff I made to my friends but I would make whatever I wanted. One of the things that I really enjoyed was making stuff with the HTML5 canvas. Over the years I made things ranging from a bouncing DVD logo to multi-player games. I realized that the more difficult a challenge was, it felt more rewarding at the end. This drove me to try get a deeper understanding of computers.</p>
<p>More than a decade has passed and as I transition to become a professional  I have to deal with home-works, Jira tickets, tasks, bugs etc and it can tiring sometimes.</p>
<p>But even after so many years whenever I create something I couldn't the day before, whenever I figure out something I couldn't understand before, it feels the same. I get the same joy from working on more complicated and theoretical projects such as compilers.</p>
<p>And there is still so many things to learn ... </p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-demo-above-work">How does the demo above work</h2>
<p>The gravitational force between two objects is defined as:
$$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$</p>
<p>Where \(G\) is the gravitational constant,\(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the masses of the objects and \(r\) is the distance between the two objects.
The direction of the force for both objects is towards each other.</p>
<p>Essentially when we consider Newton's laws of motion what we get is a system of differential equations(The forces are dependent on the positions and the positions are dependent on the speed is which dependent on the forces). Such a system is not possible to solve analytically for \(n\) many objects.</p>
<p>I used Euler's method to get an approximate solution. There are better alternatives such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration">Verlet-Integration</a> for this problem that give better approximations with the same step size, but since we are just having fun I didn't bother.</p>
<p>The code to calculate the net force on each object takes \(O(n^2)\) time however there are more efficient algorithms such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation">Barnes-Hut Approximation</a> which partition the space and consider particles that are close to each other as a single particle. I didn't felt the need to implement such an algorithm since it runs fast enough on my computer :-) </p>
